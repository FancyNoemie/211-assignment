        Imagine you go back in time to the 1970s to change the history of the internet to your own liking. Based on the events
        described in the reading, how would you do it? Would you need any funding to achieve
        the changes you seek? How much? Where do you get that funding from at the time, and how difficult is it to obtain? What does
        your answer to these questions say about the “great man theory” of history?

        To prepare the commununity to the life-changing acessibility of mass information,
        a lot of us need to learn how to deal with that much information. <br>
        Let's say we are in 1970, and I would like to raise awareness about the power
        of the media over our culture, how important and/or dangerous it can be to spread misinformation.
        In the middle of the cold war, the APRANET is being developed.
        It will grow to become what we know today as the internet, and is now widely accessible.
        Even if people didn't agree it was going to be a good or a bad change for the future, everybody agrees that it is going to completely revolutionize our social interactions.
        As we saw in the readings, there are different perspectives to the discovery of something so important. It is not the result of one single company or researcher’s work, it is rather paufined with time.
        I strongly believe that the context of a big discovery is as important as the people behind it. Unfortunately, fundings is at the base of a lot of great research. Ideas that can solve an urgent problem or make a company save money are a lot more likely to emerge and see the light of day.
        Hafner and Lyon, the researchers known for the invention of the internet, were in a political, economical, social and even military context that helped a lot. Without the cold war context, and the urge to develop more efficient ways to communicate, without the APRA computer system and the company’s funding, the internet might not even exist. They got massive support from the government in the form of a contract, and massive support from Bolt Beranek and Newman (BBN) in the form of funding.
        To make a major change like changing the people’s opinions on the media, it will need to serve specific objectives.
        I would need a propice social setup. If the people are not concerned by the issue, if the context is not there, no research company would see the point in funding my idea. I would need some kind of context that would push the people with the money to invest in research. The more money I can have access to, the more the idea will be refined and ready to be widespread. After reading Wizards, Bureaucrats, Warriors and Hackers: Writing the History of the Internet by Roy Rosenzweig, I tend to be more in tune with the social constructivism point of view of Paul N. Edwards.
        an important social context brings important changes. I don’t think I would be able to make a global change of history, because I don’t believe a single person can. I would need a greater context than just… me.
        The “great man of history” is a funny way to see things for me. I’m not saying that researchers, artists, designers, politicians and other great people of history are not talented or important, but I also believe that they were at the right place, at the right moment, and that they made the best of the situation.

        You live in the newly created country of North Turtle Island. All major online services such as social networking, online shopping, film & television streaming, videogame platforms, etc are currently provided through the internet by tech companies based in the neighboring country to your South, where they keep all their servers. These companies do not provide jobs to any of your fellow citizens, take all the profits they make out of your country, and are so powerful and well-funded that none of the local startups of North Turtle Island are able to compete with them.
        You’ve been hired by the government to help create a thriving local tech economy and re-design the network infrastructure of your country, which used to be owned by the monopoly conglomerate Omnicorp before the revolution but is now available to be put to the service of your fellow citizens however you propose it be.
        What is your proposed course of action?
      </strong>
    </h5>
    <p>
      My curse of action would first be to create a way to have a citizen-owned Internet Service Providers (ISP).
      We would first need to focus on providing for the people, not to get money. We hope that by impling citizens in the process, the system will be constantly improving in a good way, and designed for anyone, even the marginalized people. It will be a community centered system, and the management will be more suitable for our values.
      The project will need the involvement and interest of the community and a lot of funding to get off on a good start. I believe that after that the profits will be sufficient to create jobs and boost our local economy.
      In the past, I have been researching the problems regarding the production and end of the life of physical products. I would definitely need a second opinion to manage the start of such a big project. In fact, maybe a third, a fourth, a fifth… the more different opinions we have, and the more people are informed on the matter, the more chances we have to succeed in building a system that is adapted, durable, and profitable.
      It made me think of the FabCity plan, that Montréal is now a part of since last year. https://fab.city/
      Maybe North Turtle Island could adhere to that plan too, and involve citizens towards a more circular future.
